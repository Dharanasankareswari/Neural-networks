# Neural-networks
Implementing logic gates using neural networks is an exercise in understanding the fundamentals of how neural networks can approximate boolean functions. Logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc., are the building blocks of digital circuits, and neural networks can be trained to mimic their behavior.
